# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Armando Becerra Jr.

Time spent: Maybe 9 hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/iced-substantial-scabiosa?path=README.md%3A1%3A0

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [*] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [*] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [*] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [*] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [*] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [*] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [*] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [*] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [*] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [*] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [*] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
 
 I wanted to add the respected sounds that belong to the images but ran out of time.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

Nothing other than the tutorial steps in the Codepath checklist

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

I have never used HTML or Javascript so it was kinda a new thing for me.
I had some previous experience with Java and C++ so it helped me understand how to add pictures into my code in order to make them appear on the buttons.
Since the pictures are derived directly from the internet I just pasted the links and had them appear that way.
While the project was mostly step-by-step, I had a couple of typos and code in the wrong places, meaning I had to retrace my steps multiple times or restart from scratch.
Another problem I had was issues with my internet. Glitch autosaves but I guess it was caught by surprise because my internet had an outage and a lot of my work was lost and not saved, once again, meaning that I had to redo a lot of the code while reviewing the checklist to not have duplicate code.
A lot of the tutorials for the submission are specifically for Mac and that made it kinda awkward since I need to source the necessary tutorials myself in order to get some stuff to work.
Other than that I didn't have many more issues besides finding this internship opportunity a bit late, not allowing me to add a few more things before the deadline.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I had always wondered how a lot of websites were made back then in the early 2000’s.
For example, how did they make the cool banners or the interfaces that many of the flash game websites had?
I never used MySpace but I think that social media website fills a specific niche when it comes to the web development community because it allowed its users to edit and add their own personality using HTML.
Doing this project really gave me some insight that it’s not that crazy or hard of a concept to create a cool interface or UI.
It has also made me understand that the process isn’t that complicated while also appreciating the effort and time that it takes to create the websites I used to visit as a kid.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Unfortunately, I found out about this internship opportunity a bit late so I didn’t have as much time as I would have liked to add some specific things and more of myself.
Whenever I code, I like to add silly things that represent me as a person.
I would have liked to make the game faster and especially to add the funny sounds that belong to the memes or pictures that I used for the buttons.
When I added the images I sent some pictures to a friend because it made me laugh at how silly I can be with all the creative freedom that coding gives me.
